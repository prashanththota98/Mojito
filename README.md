## About the Project

This project is part of my ongoing practice with **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.
The goal is to explore advanced motion techniques such as:

- Text reveal animations using **SplitText**
- Scroll-based video scrubbing using **ScrollTrigger**
- Pinning and releasing elements during scroll
- Integrating GSAP animations cleanly with **React hooks**

## Tech Stack

- React
- GSAP (ScrollTrigger, SplitText)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## What I Learned

- How to use GSAP with React using the `useGSAP` hook
- Managing ScrollTrigger pin spacing and scroll distances
- Preventing unwanted autoplay in scroll-scrubbed videos
- Best practices for combining Tailwind CSS with GSAP animations
- Structuring animation code for cleanup and reusability
